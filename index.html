                    Hi! I am Anuradha, a multidisciplinary designer, architect, artist & writer based in Bangalore.
                    <br> My personal design philosophy is minimalist and swings from luxury minimalism to rustic minimalism.
                    <br>However, I love new challenges that push me to explore new horizons of problem-solving, aesthetic & skill.
